Article: Estimating Nitrous Oxide Emissions in Sugarcane Crops Using Machine Learning
This repository contains the code and data used in our research on estimating nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in sugarcane growing areas using machine learning techniques. 

Our research uses data collected by Embrapa Cerrados with various factors, such as nitrogen (N) fertilizer inputs, N availability in the soil, temperature, pH and soil moisture, affect N2O fluxes. These factors interact in a non-linear way, making N2O emission prediction models highly desirable for improving understanding and estimation, as well as for finding mitigation strategies.

We propose the use of data-driven machine learning techniques to estimate soil N2O fluxes in a sugarcane growing area with different irrigation regimes and contrast these results with standard analysis. Our results indicate that both the predictability and interpretability of the soil N2O emissions tested are improved with machine learning, particularly the modeling of random forests.

We hope that our results will open up new possibilities for integrating machine learning into the study of N2O fluxes for a variety of crops.
